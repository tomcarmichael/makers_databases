1. Copy the Design Recipe Template and adapt it to test-drive and implement the two classes for the books table. 

Since the table is already created, so you can skip step 1.

2. Write a small program in app.rb using the class BookRepository to print out the list of books to the terminal. 

You should get an output that looks roughly like this:

# In the project directory book_store

`$ ruby app.rb`

1 - Nineteen Eighty-Four - George Orwell
2 - Mrs Dalloway - Virginia Woolf
3 - Emma - Jane Austen
4 - Dracula - Bram Stoker
5 - The Age of Innocence - Edith Wharton
